# Cache Controller Design and Verification

A parameterized **Direct-Mapped Cache Controller** implemented in **SystemVerilog**. The project models the interaction between a CPU, cache, and main memory using a modular architecture and a finite State Machine (FSM). The design follows a modular development approach, where each hardware block is implemented, verified, and documented independently before being integrated into the complete cache controller.

## Project Objectives

* Design a parameterized Direct-Mapped Cache Controller.
* Implement cache hit and miss handling.
* Support read and write operations between the CPU and main memory.
* Build a reusable and modular RTL design.
* Verify each module using dedicated SystemVerilog testbenches.
* Integrate all modules into a complete cache subsystem.

## Features

* Parameterized cache configuration
* Modular RTL architecture
* Direct-Mapped cache organization
* Tag, Index, and Block Offset based address decoding
* Cache Hit/Miss detection
* Valid and Dirty bit management
* FSM-based cache control
* Memory interface for external RAM
* SystemVerilog verification environment
* GTKWave simulation support
